# agentup create agent findings


1. Select AI Provider (any, for example Ollama)

Validation fails as AI routing not enabled:

agentup agent validate --config agent_config.yaml
Validating agent_config.yaml...

✓ Valid YAML syntax
✓ Agent configuration valid
✓ Found 1 plugin(s)
✓ Routing configuration valid
✓ AI requirements validated
✓ Security configuration valid
✓ Middleware configuration validated (1 middleware items)
✓ System prompt validated
✓ No plugin system prompts found

Validation Results:

  Warnings:
  • AI is enabled but no plugins use AI routing. Consider disabling AI or adding AI-routed plugins

✓ Configuration is valid with warnings

agentup_config.yaml:

# Routing configuration
routing:
  default_mode: direct  # Use direct routing by default for minimal template

# AI configuration
ai_provider:
    provider: openai
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    model: gpt-4o-mini
    temperature: 0.7
    max_tokens: 1000
    top_p: 1.0

# AI system prompt and configuration

2. Test API KEY

agentup agent create
----------------------------------------
Create your AI agent:
----------------------------------------
? Agent name: Test API KEY
? Description: AI Agent Test API KEY Project.
? Would you like to customize the features? Yes
? Select features to include: [Authentication Method (API Key, Bearer(JWT), OAuth2)]
? Select authentication method: API Key (simple, good for development)

2. Test Validation

3. Test OAuth2

agentup agent create
----------------------------------------
Create your AI agent:
----------------------------------------
? Agent name: Test OAuth2
? Description: AI Agent Test OAuth2 Project.
? Would you like to customize the features? Yes
? Select features to include: [Authentication Method (API Key, Bearer(JWT), OAuth2)]
? Select authentication method: OAuth2 (enterprise-grade with provider integration)

Same as before (Warnings: AI is enabled but no plugins use AI routing. Consider disabling AI or adding AI-routed plugins)

Issue!

It uses X-API-Key, not OAuth2

security:
  enabled: true
  auth:
    api_key:
      header_name: "X-API-Key"
      location: "header"  # Options: header, query, cookie
      keys:
        - key: "tNYdw0xfGcF8CScbw_-RWbWDzq5yQyZL"
          scopes: ["api:read", "api:write", "system:read"]  # Permissions for demo plugin
  # Basic scope hierarchy for minimal template
  scope_hierarchy:
    admin: ["*"]        # Admin has all permissions
    api:write: ["api:read"]   # Write access includes read
    api:read: []        # Basic read access
    system:read: []     # System information access
    files:read: []      # File read access

3. Step 3 - Test JWT Key

Both the same issues as previous steps:

Warnings: AI is enabled but no plugins use AI routing. Consider disabling AI or adding AI-routed plugins

It uses X-API-Key, not JWT


4. Context (select all three):

Select middleware to include: done (3 selections)

only shows two (no retry)

middleware:
  - name: timed
    params: {}
  - name: cached
    params:
      ttl: 300  # 5 minutes
      # Simple plugin-aware caching for minimal template
      plugin_specific_ttl:
        local: 300      # Standard cache for local plugins
        ai_function: 60 # Shorter cache for AI functions


5. Selected MCP

No MCP in config

Also noted, MCP if selected should also include AI , as AI is needed (I think)?

6. Push Notifications:

Even if you don't select, or you do, you always get the same:

# Push notifications configuration
push_notifications:
  enabled: true
  backend: memory             # Simple memory backend for minimal template
  validate_urls: false        # Disable validation for minimal setup

I believe these should be giving as options with sub questions)


7. Extra

I think we should ask if local development environment required? If Yes:

development:
  enabled: true  # mark as true
  
  filesystem_plugins:
    enabled: true # mark as true
    allowed_directories:
      - ~/.agentup/plugins

Also ask for location of allowed_directories (and offer the default of ~/.agentup/plugins)
