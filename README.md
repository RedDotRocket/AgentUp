## Core Philosophy

AgentUp is a configuration-driven framework for building AI agents that comply with the A2A specification for agent-to-agent communication, capability discovery, and task orchestration. Through declarative configuration files and a modular architecture supporting custom plugins via Python entry points, AgentUp enables dynamic component loading, simplified maintenance, and consistent behavior across deployment environments while maintaining alignment with open standards and evolving protocol enhancements.

## Feature Overview

The framework includes pluggable middleware for rate limiting, caching, input validation, and authentication to either the core engine or individual plugins. 

State management provides persistent conversation tracking with configurable TTL and history. A customizable backend allows for file, database, or cache-based storage such as Redis or Valkey.

Security encompasses authentication, authorization, and secure communication patterns.

AgentUp leveragges scope hierarchy allows granular control over plugin capabilities, enabling fine-tuned access management, using scopes to define permissions for each capability, making it easy to integrate with OAuth2 and other scope-based bearer token systems.

Additional capabilities include asynchronous task management with state tracking, push notifications for real-time updates, agent discovery through A2A Agent Cards. AI provider support includes OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models through OpenAI-compatible APIs (Ollama).

MCP client and server support to allow your Agent to leverage the growing ecosystem of MCP servers for file storage, GitHub integration, and more, or expose your Agent's capabilities through a custom MCP endpoint.

## Project Status

AgentUp is in active development and not yet ready for production use. There will be lots of bugs,
Types need 'tightening up', and the API is still evolving.

## Contributing

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install AgentUp using pip:
```bash
pip install agentup
```

### Creating Agents

Generate a new agent project with interactive configuration:
```bash
agentup agent create my-agent
cd my-agent
```

Select from available options.

### Starting Development

Launch the development server:
```bash
agentup agent serve
```

Your agent runs at `http://localhost:8000`

From here, you really should read the [documentation](https://agentup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to understand how to configure your agent, add plugins, and customize its behavior, there are lots of examples and guides to help you get started!
